  <p><strong>Snag a time. Get booked.</strong></p>
  <p>A free, self-hostable scheduling app for availability, booking links, calendar sync, email notifications, and test payments.</p>
</div>

## What SnagTime does

SnagTime gives you the source code for your own scheduling system. You can run it locally for free, customize it, and host it on infrastructure you control.

- Account registration, sign-in, password recovery, and email verification
- Workspaces, members, invitations, and workspace switching
- Event types with multiple durations and optional test pricing
- Weekly availability, date overrides, buffers, minimum notice, and booking windows
- Public booking links with time-zone handling and custom questions
- Booking confirmation, rescheduling, cancellation, and recovery links
- Google Calendar free/busy checks and event creation
- Stripe Checkout in test mode, including webhook confirmation and refund handling
- SMTP email for organizers and invitees
- Custom workspace branding, accent colors, profile images, and uploaded logos
- SQLite for the local demo and a hardened PostgreSQL production architecture

## Set it up with Codex or Claude Code

You can give an AI coding assistant this repository URL and have it handle the local installation while it pauses for the account steps only you can complete.

Open [AI-assisted setup](docs/AI-SETUP.md), copy the student prompt, and paste it into Codex or Claude Code with this repository link:

```text
https://github.com/nateherkai/snagtime
```

The guide separates the credential-free local demo, optional integrations, and advanced public deployment so the assistant does not pull you into infrastructure work before the app runs locally.

## Five-minute local setup

### Requirements

- Node.js 20.9 or newer. Node.js 24 is the verified runtime.
- npm
- Git

### 1. Clone and enter the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nateherkai/snagtime.git
cd snagtime
```

### 2. Generate your local configuration

```bash
npm run setup
```

The setup command creates an ignored `.env.local`, generates independent cryptographic secrets, and prints the local demo login once. You can provide your own organizer login instead:

```bash
npm run setup -- --email you@example.com --password "YourStrong!Password7"
```

### 3. Install, prepare the database, and start SnagTime

```bash
npm run demo:free
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and use the login printed by the setup command.

The credential-free local mode uses SQLite, a local calendar adapter, a local email inbox, and stub payments. It does not call Google or Stripe.

## Connect your services

Copying the repository gives you all of the software. External integrations still belong to you and must be configured with your own accounts.

| Capability | What you provide | Required for local demo? |
|---|---|---:|
| Database | Nothing for SQLite, PostgreSQL for production | No |
| Public hosting | HTTPS domain plus a long-running Node web service and worker | No |
| Google Calendar | OAuth client ID and client secret | No |
| Transactional email | SMTP host, user, password, and verified sender domain | No |
| Stripe payments | Stripe test secret, publishable key, and webhook secret | No |

See [Integration setup](docs/INTEGRATION-SETUP.md) for exact callback URLs, environment variables, and verification steps.

For the Blockwise free-only deployment mode and signed booking lifecycle
events, see [Blockwise integration](docs/BLOCKWISE-INTEGRATION.md).

## Put it on the internet

SnagTime is a dynamic application, not a static website. It needs server-side Node.js execution, a persistent database, webhook endpoints, and a continuously running background worker.

- ChatGPT Sites is not a compatible production host for this repository.
- Vercel is not supported out of the box because the current production design requires a long-running worker and PostgreSQL runtime roles.
- A Linux VPS or a container platform that supports a web service, a worker service, persistent PostgreSQL, secrets, and HTTPS is the right shape.

The full production architecture is intentionally strict. It uses PostgreSQL 18, forced row-level security, separate app and worker credentials, verified database TLS, and authenticated proxy ingress. Read [Deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) before choosing a host.

## What is actually free?

The SnagTime source code is free under the MIT License. Running it locally can also cost nothing.

A public deployment can still create third-party costs:

- Hosting or a VPS
- A domain name
- Managed PostgreSQL, if your host does not include it
- Transactional email volume
- Provider fees for any services you connect

Google OAuth credentials can be created without paying SnagTime. Stripe test mode is free for testing. This release deliberately rejects Stripe live-mode keys, so do not advertise it as a live payment processor without implementing and auditing live-mode support.

## Useful commands

```bash
npm run setup          # Create .env.local and local credentials
npm run setup:check    # Validate the credential-free local configuration
npm run demo:free      # Install, migrate, seed, and run the free local demo
npm run dev            # Run the configured local development server
npm run test           # Run the unit and contract test suite
npm run typecheck      # Check TypeScript
npm run lint           # Run ESLint
npm run build          # Create the Next.js production build
npm run ci:secret-scan # Scan public source files for credential patterns
```

Database commands:

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

`npm run db:reset` destroys the local SQLite database. Use it only when you intentionally want a clean demo.

## Project status

The local SQLite experience and integration test paths are designed for demos, development, and personal experimentation. The production architecture is an advanced self-hosting path, not a one-click managed service. You are responsible for infrastructure security, backups, provider configuration, deliverability, compliance, and ongoing operations.

Please read [Security](SECURITY.md) before exposing a deployment publicly.
